    "The central concepts in calculus are derivatives and integrals. A derivative is simply a rate of change. Taking an integral is the inverse of taking a derivative. Graphically, the integral is the area under the curve. One of the easiest examples to further understand this concept is looking at distance, velocity and acceleration.\n",
